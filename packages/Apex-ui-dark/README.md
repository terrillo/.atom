# Apex-ui-dark

This theme is just a brash hack to get the lovely ![apex-ui](https://github.com/apex/apex-ui) in a _dark-mode_ version.

It is very WIP, so please submit any issues you encounter with the UI and we can update as needed.

## Installation

```
$ apm install apex-ui-dark
```

I'm using a modified version of the Atom-Material-dark syntax in this screenshot.
