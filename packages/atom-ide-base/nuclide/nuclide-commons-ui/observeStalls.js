/*
 * Often times users take an action and can resonably expect a long, blocking task
 * to run to completion before they can take action again:
 * https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail#ux
 * This is analagous to a web page or app's initial loading, transitioning to
 * another significant view, etc.
 *
 * This is a decorator that wraps a function that pauses in response to user action,
 * opting it out of stall observation and forwarding any arguments passed and returning
 * the original function's return value.
 *
 * **Use this cautiously and deliberately, only in situations where it is
 * reasonable for a user to expect a pause!**
 *
 * If the action takes longer than 1s, we still record this as a stall, as it
 * fails the RAIL model's definition of responsive loading.
